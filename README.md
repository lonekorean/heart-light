# heart-light

Simple Netlify site for controlling a light in the real world.

Contains example code for my blog post, [Making a Heart Light with IFTTT and Netlify Functions](https://codersblock.com/blog/making-a-heart-light-with-ifttt-and-netlify-functions/). You'll probably want to read that for context and to set up the other stuff you'll need outside of this repo.

Don't forget to update `/netlify/functions/heart-light.js` with your IFTTT key!
